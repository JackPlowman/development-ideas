## Ideas

This is a list of ideas that I have for myself to work on.

### Repository Visualisation GitHub Action

- Create a GitHub Action that visualises the repository structure using a diagram. Similar to [repo-visualizer](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer).

Features:

- Shows the repository structure
- Link to each file
- Image will be SVG

Tech Stack:

- Languages to consider for idea:
  - Go
  - Rust
  - Python UV/Jupyter Notebook

### Implement all (important) sorting algorithms in Python

- Create a repository that shows off all sorting algorithms in Python

### Add a status page for my projects which are deployed to GitHub Pages

Features:

- Shows the status of my projects
- Send a notification when a project not available

### GitHub Branch Analysis GitHub Action

- Create a GitHub Action that analyses the branch and creates a report
